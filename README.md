			<h2>Home Page</h2>
			<p>The home page of my project is a beautiful parallax page that showcases my completed projects during the internship. It has a clean and modern design with a prominent banner that introduces the page's purpose. There are three project cards on the home page, and each card has a thumbnail image, a brief description of the project, and a link to view it. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the parallax effect, and I added smooth scrolling to make it user-friendly. The home page sets the tone for the rest of the projects and provides an excellent user experience.</p><br>

		<h2>Project 3: Online Code Editor</h2>
		<p>This project is an online code editor that allows users to write, edit, and run HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code directly in their web browser. The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with separate panels for code editing, previewing, and console output.

The code editor supports syntax highlighting and auto-completion, making it easier for users to write and debug their code. The preview panel allows users to see the output of their code in real-time, while the console panel displays any errors or output messages.

This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and utilizes the CodeMirror library for the code editor functionality. It demonstrates proficiency in working with external libraries and APIs, as well as the ability to design and implement a complex web application. This project was completed as part of the CodeClause Community internship program, and showcases the ability to create a professional-level tool for developers .</p>

		<h2>Project 4:Integrate Payment Gateway</h2>
		<p>This project involves integrating a payment gateway into a web application to allow users to make secure online payments. The payment gateway used in this project is Stripe, which provides a simple and secure way to handle online transactions.

The web application is designed to sell products or services, with a user interface that displays product information and allows users to select and purchase items. Once the user selects a product and proceeds to checkout, they are redirected to the Stripe payment page to enter their payment information.

Once the payment is processed, the user is redirected back to the web application with a confirmation message and receipt. The payment gateway integration ensures that the payment is secure and that the user's sensitive information is protected.

This project was completed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the Stripe API for payment processing. It demonstrates proficiency in working with external APIs and integrating complex functionality into a web application. This project was completed as part of the CodeClause Community internship program, and showcases the ability to create a professional-level e-commerce solution.</p>
